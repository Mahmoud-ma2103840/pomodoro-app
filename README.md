# Pomodoro Timer

## Description
The Pomodoro Timer is a desktop application designed to help improve productivity by using the Pomodoro technique. Created in May 2021 (before starting my university degree), this application provides a simple and effective way to manage time with work sessions and breaks, promoting sustained concentration and preventing burnout.

## Features
- Simple and attractive tomato-themed GUI.
- Customizable work (25 minutes) and break intervals (5 minutes for short breaks and 20 minutes for long breaks).
- Visual and textual countdown timer.
- Session tracker with a visual representation of completed sessions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter installed (usually comes pre-installed with Python).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone <https://github.com/Mahmoud-ma2103840/pomodoro-app>
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd path/to/Pomodoro-Timer
3. Run the application:
python main.py


## How to Use
- Start the timer to begin a work session.
- After the work session, the timer will automatically start the break.
- Use the "Pause" button to pause the timer and "Resume" to continue.
- The "Reset" button will stop the current session/break and reset the timer.
- Completed sessions are indicated by check marks.
